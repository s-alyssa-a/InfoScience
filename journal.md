# *Hola, this is my journal for Info Sci | Jan 30th 2020*

1. **What did we do?**

We introduced ourselves, got an introduction to computational thinking and discovered alghorithm thinking by giving instructions to make a jelly sandwich.

2. **What did you learn?**

In alghorithm thinking, you have to be detailed because a supercomputer can only be a supercomputer if you feed it superinstructions. Computational thinking is also not limited to only computer-related skills, but it is a way of thinking that can be applied to all kinds of problem in real life as well.

3. **What questions do I have?**

I only have questions about how to create a shape on Processing, which I will find out the answers to while exploring and doing research on it later.
