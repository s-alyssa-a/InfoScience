# *My 2nd Info Science Journal Entry | Feb 6th 2020*

1. **What did we do?**

We reviewed last coding challenge and did some exploring using circles and vertical lines on Processing.

2. **What did you learn?**

That you have to be extremely detailed and focused when coding - one missing paranthesis could mean everything. It's a bit frustrating when it happens, but it teaches me each time.

3. **What questions do I have?**

How do I only put colour on one shape and a different color for the other?

# Solution to the homework 

This time I solved the code challenge to create the a dice in Processing using Phyton.

```.py

x = 0
shape = 0

def setup():
  size(600, 600)
  background (255)

def draw ():
    square(150, 100, 300)
    
def draw():
    
    myred = (0)

    fill(myred)

        
    circle(200, 150, 55)
    circle(300, 250, 55)
    circle(200, 350, 55)
    circle(400, 150, 55)
    circle(400, 350, 55)
    
```
