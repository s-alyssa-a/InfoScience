1. **What did we do?**

We were given a piece of paper and instructions to create a chess pattern.

2. **What did you learn?**

In alghorithm thinking, you have to be detailed because a supercomputer can only be a supercomputer if you feed it superinstructions. Computational thinking is also not limited to only computer-related skills, but it is a way of thinking that can be applied to all kinds of problem in real life as well.

3. **What questions do I have?**

I only have questions about how to create a shape on Processing, which I will find out the answers to while exploring and doing research on it later.

# Homework

1. Research about optical illusions 
2. Select one optical illusion that is simple enough
3. Try to code the illusion in Processing 

# Solution to the homework 

Here I solved the code challenge to create the first letter of my name by using squares in Processing.

```.py

square(10, 10, 20);
square(30, 10, 20);
square(50, 10, 20);
square(70, 10, 20);

square(10, 30, 20);
square(10, 50, 20);

square(30, 50, 20);
square(50, 50, 20);
square(70, 50, 20);

square(70, 70, 20);

square(70, 90, 20);
square(50, 90, 20);
square(30, 90, 20);
square(10, 90, 20);

```
