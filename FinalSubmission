2. This second semester of Info Science has definitely been challenging and insightful, but nonetheless I'm glad I got to learn something entirely new to me. I have no prior knowledge of coding and this has been really eye-opening. While I don't intend on taking Computer Science next year in the IB, I am happy I got to experience this second semester exploring it and that there are a lot of support in this course.
